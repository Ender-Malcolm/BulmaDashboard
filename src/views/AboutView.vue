    <div class="container">
      <p>Hi there, my name is Nathan, and this is my Weather Station site. This was my Capstone Project for 2022
        while I was in attendance of South Hills School of Business and Technology.
      </p>
      <p>I built this weather station and API system because it would require many of my skills and a lot of
        responsibility. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Object one</li>
          <li>Object 2</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<style scoped>
  .title {
    text-align: center;
  }
  
  p {
    color:antiquewhite;
    text-align:center;
    font-size:large;
    text-decoration: wavy;
  }

  .container {
    background-color:#9393c7;
    margin-left: 5rem;
    margin-right:5rem;
    min-height: 20rem;
  }
</style>
